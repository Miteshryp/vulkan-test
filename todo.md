# TODAY's GOALS

[x] Model View Projection matrix integration

[] Create a new mechanism for persistent descriptors
[] Create a mechanism for passing dynamic data in push descriptors

[] descriptor set updates
[] push constants
[] push descriptors

# Questions
1. When to push constants vs push descriptor

# FUTURE GOALS
[] Multipass / Deffered rendering
[] Instanced Rendering
[] Different types of lighting
[] Texture rendering in shaders
[] Dynamic shader loading




# MISC GOALS
[] Learn about writing macros in rust
[] Explore the vulkan and SPIR-V sdk tools
[] Explore NVRHI

# WORKAROUNDS
- [] Renderdoc integration for shader debugging - FAILED (binding not working with renderdoc 1.30)
