# TODAY's GOALS

[x] Solve the global store problem in rust. - Will be solved using plugins (like in nest.js)

[] Texture rendering in shaders


# FUTURE GOALS
[] Multipass / Deffered rendering
[] Different types of lighting

[] Indirect drawing
[] Dynamic shader loading



# MISC GOALS
[] Learn about writing macros in rust
[] Explore the vulkan and SPIR-V sdk tools
[] Explore NVRHI

# WORKAROUNDS
- [] Renderdoc integration for shader debugging - FAILED (binding not working with renderdoc 1.30)
