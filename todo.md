# TODAY's GOALS

[] Model View Projection matrix integration
    - [] nalgebra integration
    - [] vulkan pushconstants



# FUTURE GOALS
[] Multipass / Deffered rendering
[] Instanced Rendering
[] Different types of lighting
[] Texture rendering in shaders
[] Dynamic shader loading




# MISC GOALS
[] Learn about writing macros in rust
[] Explore the vulkan and SPIR-V sdk tools
[] Explore NVRHI

# WORKAROUNDS
- [] Renderdoc integration for shader debugging - FAILED (binding not working with renderdoc 1.30)
